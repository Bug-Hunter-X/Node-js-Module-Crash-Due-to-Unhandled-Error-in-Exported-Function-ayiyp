```javascript
function myFunc() {
  // Some code here
}

module.exports = myFunc; // Exporting the function
```
This code works fine in most cases. However, if `myFunc` throws an error and is not handled within the function itself, it will cause the module to crash, leading to unexpected behavior in the application.  If another module requires `myFunc` and it crashes, the error won't necessarily propagate properly and debugging becomes difficult.  This can happen in asynchronous code particularly easily.
